'''
Sets are a data type, similar to lists or tuples. However, the order of the elements inside sets isn't fixed (a sets
elements aren't indexed) and sets only recognize each element once (so it doesn't register I guess, duplicates).

set = {"hi", "hello", "greetings", "By The Light!", "hello"}
print(set)
print(len(set))
