from Student_class import Student

'''
We have imported the data type "Student". Now we will create an object (a variable) called "student1". So to put it
perhaps more clearly and concisely, the class is the data type and the object is an application or instance of the
class.
Printing one element of the object, say the name of student1, is easy as shown below. However, in order to print all
the information of student1 it's more complicated, according to what I read online.
'''

student1 = Student("Jim", "Business", 3.1, False)
print(student1.name)
